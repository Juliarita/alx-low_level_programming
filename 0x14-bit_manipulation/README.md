0. `write a function that converts a binary unmber to ann unsigned int.
1. write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
2. write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
3. write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
4. write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
5. write a function that return the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
6. write a function that checks the endianness.
